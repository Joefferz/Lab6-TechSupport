/**
 * This class implements a technical support system. It is the top level class 
 * in this project. The support system communicates via text input/output 
 * in the text terminal.
 * 
 * This class uses an object of class InputReader to read input from the user,
 * and an object of class Responder to generate responses. It contains a loop
 * that repeatedly reads input and generates output until the users wants to 
 * leave.
